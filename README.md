Consumer Complaints NLP Analysis
üìã Project Overview
This project implements a comprehensive NLP analysis of consumer complaints from the CFPB dataset using topic modeling techniques. The analysis identifies key themes in consumer complaints through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) methods.

üéØ Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and stopword removal

Topic Modeling: Implementation of both LDA and NMF algorithms

Comparative Analysis: Side-by-side comparison of LDA vs NMF results

üìä Results Summary
Optimal Topics: 2 topics identified

Coherence Score: 0.5815

Topic Distribution:

Topic 1: 470 documents (9.4%) - Focus on claims, reporting, and collections

Topic 2: 4527 documents (90.6%) - Focus on accounts, credit, and consumer reports

Coherence score plot: Visual representation of topic optimization

Key Metrics:
Coherence Score: 0.5815 (indicates good topic quality)

Optimal Topics: 2

Model Comparison: LDA and NMF show consistent topic identification

üé™ Identified Topics
Topic 1: Claims & Collections (9.4%)
Keywords: claim, reporting, collection, debt, compliance, plaintiff

Topic 2: Accounts & Credit Reports (90.6%)
Keywords: account, credit, consumer, report, information, deletion, qualified, entry

üìù Interpretation
The analysis reveals two dominant themes in consumer complaints:

Financial Claims & Legal Issues: Focus on debt collection, compliance, and legal proceedings

Account Management & Credit Reporting: Dominant theme covering credit reports, account information, and data management issues
